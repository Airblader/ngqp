        Let's take a look at the three basic steps you should follow to use ngqp. This will show you the basic usage
        of ngqp in order to synchronize your controls with the URL and how to connect this to your application so that
        you can actually perform actions when parameters change.
    </p>

    <docs-fragment fragment="define-model">
        <h2>Step 1: Defining the Model</h2>
    </docs-fragment>
    <p>
        First, we need to define what our model, the <span apiDocsLink>QueryParamGroup</span>, looks like. In here you
        define which query parameters you need as well as how they are defined: what type do they have, how are the values
        (de-)serialized to and from the URL as well as a bunch of other options.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to define the model, you can inject the <span apiDocsLink>QueryParamBuilder</span> into your component
        and use its <code>group</code> method to create the model. Inside the group, you can use its other methods to
        create the individual models for each query parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a simple example of what this looks like in an application. To learn about the features we ship and how
        to configure them, see <docs-link [page]="DocsPage.MODEL_CONFIGURATION"></docs-link>.
    </p>

    <docs-fragment fragment="bind-model">
        <h2>Step 2: Binding the Model</h2>
    </docs-fragment>
    <p>
        Now that we define what the model for our parameters looks like, it's time to bind this model to the form
        controls that the user interacts with. To do this, we need a parent with
        <span apiDocsLink="QueryParamGroupDirective">queryParamGroup</span> and then the individual form controls which
        are bound using <span apiDocsLink="QueryParamNameDirective">queryParamName</span>.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        To bind a component to the model, the component has to have a <a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor">ControlValueAccessor</a>
        provided to it (the same mechanism that is used in the Forms API). ngqp ships standard implementations for basic
        form elements such as inputs, but if you have custom components you may need to implement this.
        For more information, see <docs-link [page]="DocsPage.CUSTOM_CONTROL_VALUE_ACCESSOR"></docs-link>.
    </div>
    <demo-snippet type="html" [code]="bindModelSnippet"></demo-snippet>
    <p>
        As you can see, <span apiDocsLink="QueryParamNameDirective">queryParamName</span> refers to the name we gave to
        the query param model. The <span apiDocsLink="QueryParam">param</span> attribute specified inside the model is
        the name of the parameter we will actually see in the URL.
    </p>

    <docs-fragment fragment="use-model">
        <h2>Step 3: Using the Model</h2>
    </docs-fragment>
    <p>
        At this point, the synchronization is already working: if we change the form controls, the URL will update and
        vice versa. However, we want to actually <em>do</em> something with these values &mdash; like re-fetching some
        resources based on these settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to do this, we can use the <span apiDocsLink>QueryParamGroup#valueChanges</span> observable.
        It will emit whenever the values change, so we don't need to worry about tracking the URL ourselves. Every value
        it emits contains the current value of each parameter in our model.
    </p>

    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        As with other observables, don't forget to unsubscribe from this observable, e.g., by using a
        <code>takeUntil</code> operator.
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        For the common use-case of fetching resources from an API, you should pipe the <code>valueChanges</code> observable
        to your API using an operator such as <code>switchMap</code>. This avoids race conditions if the values change
        multiple times in quick succession.
