        <h2>What is ngqp?</h2>
    </docs-fragment>
    <p>
        ngqp is all about the URL &mdash; or, to be precise, about the very last part of it. Let's take a look at this
        example:
    </p>

    <div class="my-3">
        <demo-snippet type="none" code="https://app.io/categories/computer/products?q=X1&manufacturer=Lenovo&costsLessThan=1500"></demo-snippet>
    </div>

    <p>
        This, and any other, URL consists of a few different parts. As an Angular developer, chances are you are most
        familiar with the <em>route</em> of it. However, if we look beyond the route, we can see the <em>query parameters</em>.
        These are an arbitrary list of parameters to the URL which can occur in arbitrary order or even multiple times.
    </p>
    <p>
        This makes query parameters an ideal choice for representing state such as filter or search settings. You may
        be thinking to yourself: why should I even bother? Fair point! Here's a couple of reasons for why encoding such
        state in the URL is a worthwhile effort:
    </p>
    <ul class="checkmark-list">
        <li>The state can be persisted across reloads</li>
        <li>URLs can be bookmarked and shared</li>
        <li>If the user navigates away and comes back using the back button, the state will remain active</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        However, keeping these parameters in sync with your application's state can be tricky, particularly if you want
        to make sure that changes to the parameters can happen either from the URL or programmatically, or if you need
        to serialize more complex state into the URL.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is where ngqp comes in: it provides you with a simple, declarative approach to define a <em>model</em> of
        what parameters you want to work with. This model can then be wired up with your form controls and ngqp will
        worry about the rest.
    </p>

        <h2>Our first example</h2>
    </docs-fragment>
    <p>
        You might be thinking »That sounds great, but what does this look like in practice?« To answer this question,
        we'll just take a look at our first example; and we'll use the URL we discussed above to demonstrate it!

        <h2>When should I use ngqp?</h2>
    </docs-fragment>
    <p>
        ngqp is a great choice for use-cases which fit the following criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have form controls that represent some transient user settings (search, filter, sort, …)</li>
        <li>These form controls are not hooked up with some form (using <code>ngModel</code> or reactive forms)</li>
        <li>You want these settings to be persisted across reloads</li>
        <li>You want your link to be shareable such that these settings are part of it</li>
    </ul>

    <docs-fragment fragment="when-not-to-use">
        <h2>When should I <em>not</em> use ngqp?</h2>
    </docs-fragment>
    <p>
        If it isn't a nail, don't use a hammer &mdash; ngqp might not be the best choice for all use-cases. Here are
        some indicators for situations where you might not want to use ngqp:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You need to submit this state in a form (there's no need to real-time synchronize parameters here)</li>
        <li>You need to use the Forms API or Reactive Forms API (this unfortunately interferes with ngqp)</li>
    </ul>
